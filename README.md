Resume Website and Brute Force Defender Showcase:

Resume Website:
My personal resume website showcases my professional experience and skills. It provides an overview of my career journey, highlighting key achievements and a small but fun Python game I created. The website is designed to give visitors a comprehensive view of my qualifications and some of the more "fun" projects I develop.

Brute Force Defender (Python Game)
"Brute Force Defender" is a top-down turret style Python-based game I developed to challenge players with strategic decision-making and quick thinking! Players defend against simulated brute force attacks by the nefarious black hat hacker then shoot lightning bolts at the incoming botnet to defend the server!!! A score counter is also included in the game to keep track of progress.
